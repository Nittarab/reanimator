# Test Repository

This is a test repository with intentionally buggy code for testing the AI SRE remediation workflow.

## Known Bugs

1. **users.js**: `getUserById()` does not handle missing users
2. **math.js**: `calculateAverage()` does not handle empty arrays (division by zero)
3. **math.js**: `calculatePercentage()` does not handle zero denominator

These bugs are intentional for testing purposes.
